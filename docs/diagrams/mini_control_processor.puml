package "Mini Control Processor (MCU)" {
  [RISC-V Core (5-stage)] as CPU
  [I/D Memory (IMEM/DMEM)] as MEM
  [MMIO / CSR] as MMIO
  [Interrupt Controller] as IRQ
  [Watchdog / Timers] as WDG
}

cloud "System MMIO / Mailbox" as MMIO_BUS

CPU --> MEM : fetch / data
CPU --> MMIO : CSR reads/writes
MMIO --> MMIO_BUS : mailbox base / status
IRQ --> CPU : IRQ lines (mailbox, faults)
WDG --> CPU : watchdog IRQ

note right of MMIO
MCU firmware responsibilities:
- Service ingress mailboxes
- Configure compute-unit CSRs (cmd ring)
- Service faults & watchdog
