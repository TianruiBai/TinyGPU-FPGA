# Diagrams (PlantUML)

The `.puml` files in this folder are intended to be viewed with PlantUML.

## VS Code
- Install a PlantUML extension (e.g. *PlantUML*).
- Open a `.puml` file and use the extension preview.

## CLI (optional)
If you have PlantUML installed locally, you can render with:
- `plantuml -tpng docs/diagrams/*.puml`

(Exact command depends on how PlantUML is installed on your machine.)
